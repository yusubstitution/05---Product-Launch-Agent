# Product Requirement Document: Claude for Structural Engineering
**Product Manager:** Jason Yu
**Status:** Draft

## Overview
We are launching a specialized version of Claude 5.0 Sonnet fine-tuned on structural engineering codes (IBC 2024, Eurocode) to assist architects in calculating load-bearing requirements for steel beams.

## Key Features
1. **Blueprint Analysis:** Users upload PDF blueprints. Claude identifies potential structural weaknesses.
2. **Load Calculation:** Users query: "Calculate the shear force for a W12x26 beam spanning 20ft." Claude returns the mathematical proof.
3. **Material Estimation:** Estimates cost of raw materials based on current steel futures.

## Success Metrics
- 95% accuracy on standard civil engineering licensure exam questions.
- <2s latency for calculation responses.
